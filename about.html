						<p class="prize">This plugin is called anime.js. I used it to create animation on the Title of each web page. I was able to make each word pop up one by one, and set the delay of one word showing up after the other. </p>
						 <p class="prize">This animation can be customized, you could also make the words appear and disappear by looping the animation, however since I used it for titles I turned the loop to false.</p>
						 <p class="prize">Moreover, anime.js does not only do this, there are so many more things you can do with it, including 3d animation. However, most features can be very complex and require to learn more about how to implement them properly.</p>
